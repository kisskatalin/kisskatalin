Hello. I am Katalin Kiss.
<br>UX/UI designer with coding skills.

Amazed by technology, I'm keen on interactions between human and computer. My interest in digital world naturally led me into UX and UI design. My curiousity encouraged me to go deeper into these fields, draw sketches of wireframes on paper, spend times using graphics tools, I eventually found my love for pixels and my thirst of knowledge has not stopped. As a forever learner and ambitious creator, I like discovering new things, watching the users and fulfilling their needs by solving their problems with usable interfaces.
